# Isomer Research Contract

Use this local reference for terminology, evidence boundaries, runtime boundaries, and TBD placeholders. This skill must be self-contained, so do not load source-tree files or source-analysis notes to execute it.

## Truth-Source Order

Prefer durable records over recollection:

1. User instruction and explicit Gate decisions through the Operator Agent.
2. Decision Records, Artifacts, Evidence Items, Findings, Research Claims, and Provenance Records.
3. Workspace Runtime state, Run records, handoffs, Signal Observations, and validated View Manifests.
4. Agent Artifacts and Agent Runtime notes that have clear provenance.
5. Conversation context, only when durable state is absent or being interpreted.

## Durable Vocabulary

Use Isomer Labs terms: Research Topic, Research Inquiry, Research Inquiry Relationship, Research Task, Run, Topic Workspace, Workspace Runtime, Agent Workspace, Agent Runtime, Workspace Boundary, Artifact, Agent Artifact, Evidence Item, Finding, Research Claim, Decision Record, Gate, Provenance Record, Signal Observation, Operator Agent, Agent Role, Agent Instance, Agent Team Instance, Agent Team Instance lifecycle state, Coordination Policy, Capability Binding, Execution Adapter, Workflow Stage, Workflow Stage Cursor, and Completion Watcher Contract.


## Workspace Path Resolution

Ordinary Project, Topic Workspace, Workspace Runtime, task support, Run, Artifact, View Manifest, log, Agent Workspace, and Agent Runtime paths are resolved surfaces. Ask for semantic targets such as Topic Workspace, Workspace Runtime, task support directory, run log Artifact, experiment output Artifact, analysis output Artifact, figure output Artifact, paper Artifact, decision Artifact, evidence Artifact, finding Artifact, handoff Artifact, Agent Workspace scratch, Agent Runtime state, or Agent Artifact.

Do not emit ordinary path TBD placeholders for these surfaces. Workspace plans have precedence, then supported Execution Adapter `ISOMER_*` environment variables, then Project Manifest defaults, then built-in defaults. Environment variables are launch-time adapter inputs, not durable truth; resolved effective paths and their source belong in Workspace Runtime or Provenance Records.

## Research Recording Contracts

Artifacts, Provenance Records, Evidence Items, Findings, Research Claims, Decision Records, and Gates are resolved durable record surfaces. Use accepted recording APIs for Artifact and Provenance recording, Finding query/write, and Gate open/resolve/record behavior.

Do not emit recording TBD placeholders for these surfaces. Evidence Items are the support, contradiction, or context boundary for Research Claims. Research Claim status is `open`, `supported`, `refuted`, or `withdrawn` unless a later accepted contract extends it; contradiction and context belong on Evidence Items or claim-evidence links. Findings are primarily scoped to Research Inquiries when an applicable inquiry exists. A Gate may resolve through a Decision Record, but cancelled or superseded Gates can close with a Provenance Record when no meaningful choice was made.

## Research Lifecycle State

Research Topic, Research Inquiry, Research Inquiry Relationship, Research Task, Run, Workflow Stage Cursor, and Agent Team Instance lifecycle state are resolved lifecycle surfaces. Use Workflow Stage Cursor for durable routing state, not scheduling. Use Agent Team Instance lifecycle state for planned, active, paused, blocked, completed, stopped, or archived team execution state; optional active or relevant Research Inquiry refs are context and routing anchors, not execution scope. Use Research Inquiry Relationships for inquiry graph links and require Decision Records only when a meaningful route choice was made.

Do not emit lifecycle TBD placeholders for `schema-stage-cursor`, `schema-agent-team-state`, or `policy-branching`. Research Inquiry is a question object and not a parallel execution scope. Express parallel work only as Topic-level parallelism across Agent Team Instances or Task-level parallelism across Agent Instances inside one Agent Team Instance.

## Source-Term Mappings

| Source term or operation | Isomer Labs framing |
| --- | --- |
| surface class | figure target surface recorded on an Artifact or Provenance Record |
| paper figure catalog | figure-output Artifact index through Workspace Path Resolution |
| style asset | local asset or Capability Binding selected by the host |
| render-inspect-revise pass | Evidence Item plus Provenance Record for the figure Artifact |
| export schema | existing Artifact, Evidence Item, Provenance Record, and figure-output surfaces until a dedicated schema is accepted |
| plotting execution | Capability Binding through an Execution Adapter |

## Evidence Boundaries

A polished figure can support communication, but it does not create the underlying evidence. Link every figure-level claim to source Evidence Items, Research Claims, or Decision Records. Keep visual limitations, partial evidence, failed renders, and contradictory data visible when they affect interpretation.

## Runtime Boundary

This skill describes figure-polishing judgment. It does not define Isomer ordinary path layouts covered by Workspace Path Resolution, command APIs, notebook runtimes, asset registries, or export schemas. Name semantic Artifact kinds or workspace scopes for output locations; use registered TBD placeholders only for unsettled non-path surfaces.

## TBD Surface Registry

Use registered TBD-surface placeholders in skill outcomes when a concrete surface is not settled by an accepted Isomer design. Ordinary Project, Topic Workspace, Workspace Runtime, Run, Artifact, View Manifest, log, Agent Workspace, and Agent Runtime paths are settled by Workspace Path Resolution. Artifacts, Provenance Records, Evidence Items, Findings, Research Claims, Decision Records, and Gates are settled by Research Recording Contracts. Research Topics, Research Inquiries, Research Inquiry Relationships, Research Tasks, Runs, Workflow Stage Cursors, and Agent Team Instance lifecycle state are settled by Research Lifecycle State. Skills should name semantic workspace scopes, Artifact kinds, durable record types, accepted recording APIs, or accepted lifecycle objects instead of emitting TBD placeholders for resolved surfaces.
